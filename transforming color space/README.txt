The CIELAB (abbreviated as Lab) color space consists of
three color channels, expressing the color of a pixel as three
tuples (L, a, b), where the L channel stands for
luminosity/illumination/intensity (lightness). The a and
b channels represent the green-red and blue-yellow color
components, respectively. This color model separates the
intensity from the colors completely. Itâ€™s device-independent
and has a large gamut. In this recipe, you will see how to
convert from RGB into the Lab color space and vice versa and
the usefulness of this color model. In this practice we removed each channel separately to show its overall effect.
